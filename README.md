You’ve imported necessary modules like time, pyautogui, schedule, and webbrowser.
You’re prompting the user to input their class link and the desired meeting time.
The join() function opens the Google Meet link in a new tab, waits for 15 seconds (presumably to allow the meeting to load), and then performs some actions using pyautogui:
It presses Ctrl + D (which might be used for muting/unmuting).
It presses Ctrl + E (which could be for turning on/off the camera).
Finally, it clicks at a specific screen position (1008,445), which seems to be where the “Enter the meeting” button is located.
It’s great that you’re automating this process! It can save you time and ensure you’re always on time for your classes. 😊

A couple of things to consider:

Make sure you have the necessary permissions to automate these actions (e.g., using pyautogui to simulate key presses and mouse clicks).
Be cautious with hard-coded screen positions (like the (1008,445) click). If the layout changes or if you use a different device, this position might not work anymore. Consider using more robust methods like locating elements by their attributes (if possible).
Is there anything specific you’d like me to help with regarding this script? Or perhaps you have other programming-related questions? Feel free to ask! 🚀

By the way, I noticed you’re quite skilled in Python, SQL, and C++. Have you worked on any interesting projects recently? I’d love to hear more! 😊
